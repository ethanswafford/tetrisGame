This is a small project, mainly just for sharpening my knowledge and skills.

|A CLASSIC GAME|
  "TETRIS"
Using Javascript , HTML, and CSS I am making a basic tetris style game, mainly focused on functionality, and features
over  appearance at the present. I may keep this around and slowly build on it in the future.
